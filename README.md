Haithon
=======

A Haskell parser for a subset of the Python language. The intention of this project is two-fold! Firstly, I wish to try out Parsec's handling of indentation sensitive languages, and secondly I want to experiment with using this as some course material!

Grammar
-------

The grammar is loosely based off of the official Python 3 grammar https://docs.python.org/3/reference/grammar.html
